In this project, I conducted a security audit of a web application with the goal of finding the credentials for logging in using the brute-force tool Hydra. My objective was to perform an attack on the authentication form by iterating through possible passwords and usernames using dictionaries.

First, I checked standard credentials like admin:admin and admin:password. These didn’t work, but the server returned the error "Wrong password. Please try again.", which allowed me to understand that the authentication form uses POST requests to the /login.php file. Based on this, I used Hydra to brute-force the password for the fixed username admin, selecting the popular rockyou.txt password list. As a result, I was able to find the valid password password123 for the admin user.

I then tried to log in to the site with the found credentials (admin:password123), but this didn’t work. This made me realize that the admin username was incorrect, so I decided to search for another username. By this point, I knew the password password123, so I proceeded to attack the username using the names.txt dictionary. However, when I tried to run the attack with this dictionary, I encountered an issue: the names.txt file was not found on my system. As a result, I installed the SecLists repository, which contains the necessary dictionaries, and continued my work.

After installing SecLists, I used Hydra again to brute-force the username with the names.txt file. The result was the discovery of the correct login: jose. After that, I was able to successfully log into the system using the credentials jose:password123.

In the end, I gained access to the web application using the credentials jose:password123. Throughout this project, I identified several vulnerabilities in the authentication system, such as the use of simple passwords and the possibility of performing brute-force attacks. This project highlighted the importance of using more complex passwords and additional protection against brute-force attacks, such as CAPTCHAs or limits on the number of login attempts.
